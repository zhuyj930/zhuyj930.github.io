title: "Examining Attendee Motivation and Satisfaction at an Immersive Art Exhibition: A Case Study of the Van Gogh Exhibition"
description: >
  In recent years, academic research has delved deeper into the realm of visitor motivation and satisfaction within museums and galleries. However, a specific dimension - the immersive art exhibition - remains largely unexplored in terms of attendee motivation and satisfaction. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap by quantitatively examining the factors that motivate individuals to engage in immersive art experiences and determining whether their expectations are met. The Van Gogh immersive art exhibitions, which are the one of the earliest organised immersive art exhibitions and the most popular ones in the world, serves as the focal case study. A mixed-method approach, encompassing survey-based analysis and text analysis, was employed for this study. In the survey study, eight motivations factors were proposed based on the characteristics of this immersive art exhibition, from both personal and societal contexts. Five satisfaction factors which correspond to the motivations were also investigated for testing whether the expectations of attendee were met or not by the exhibitions. For text analysis, a dataset was compiled from Twitter and Facebook, consisting of posts that detailed personal experiences, feelings, and opinions related to the Van Gogh immersive art exhibitions. Sentiment analysis was performed and word cloud visualisations were generated for evaluating the attendee attitude towards the exhibitions. Results indicated that novelty was the most important motivation for attendance, and both the survey study and text analysis consistently showed high levels of satisfaction towards the Van Gogh immersive art
  exhibitions.

### Introduction
## Introduction: Unmasking the Immersive Art Experience

This research delves into the burgeoning world of immersive art exhibitions, exploring what motivates people to attend and how satisfied they are with the experience. While previous studies have focused on the technology behind these exhibitions, this research centers on the attendee, bridging a gap in understanding their motivations and satisfaction.

Building upon existing research on visitor motivations in traditional museums and galleries, this study examines the unique appeal of immersive art exhibitions, considering them as an evolution of traditional art spaces.  By understanding what draws audiences to these new formats, we can gain valuable insights into the future of art engagement.

This research employs a novel dual-methodology approach:

* **Traditional Surveys:**  Measuring eight key motivation factors (novelty, learning, escapism, entertainment, self-expression, personal interest, social interaction, and recommendation) and five corresponding satisfaction factors.
* **Big Data Text Analysis:** Leveraging the power of social media and advanced language models like GPT-4.0 to analyze sentiment and opinions expressed about the Van Gogh immersive art exhibition, a popular and representative example of this art form.

The popular Van Gogh exhibition, having attracted over 5 million visitors, provides a rich dataset for text analysis from platforms like Twitter and Facebook.  This combined approach offers a comprehensive understanding of attendee experience.  Preliminary findings suggest that *novelty* is a primary motivator, and overall satisfaction with the Van Gogh exhibition is high.
